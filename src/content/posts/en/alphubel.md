# Alpine tour to the [Alphubel](https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/huetten-und-touren/sac-tourenportal/alphubel-7757/hochtouren/von-der-taeschhuette-sac-ueber-den-suedost-grat-eisnase-647/)

This was the first unguided alpine tour after the course on the Großvenediger some weeks before.
Also it was my first 4000er ever.

## The plan

Initially we planned to drive to Saas-Fee, take the cable car to the [Britanniahütte](https://britannia.ch/) and then push for the [Allalinhorn](https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/huetten-und-touren/sac-tourenportal/allalinhorn-7755/hochtouren/von-der-britanniahuette-vollstaendiger-ene-grat-hohlaubgrat-1195/) (4027m) the next day. The following night we wanted to camp in the valley and do the [Weissmies](https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/huetten-und-touren/sac-tourenportal/weissmies-2192/hochtouren/) (4017m).

## The journey

Our plan was to start on September 6th at 8:00 in the morning. Due to some circumstances we started at 8:30, which would change our destiny a bit (so we thought).

1. We realize after some hours, that due to our late start we would not have made it in time for the cable car to our hut, with its last ride at 15:45/16:00.
2. Our driver forgot to disable "Avoid ferries" in Google maps, which led us to realize we were heading straight to a car train. This train transports cars through a tunnel on our way to Saas-Fee. ![Autozug](src/assets/images/alphubel/autozug.jpg)
3. When we reached Stalden, we noticed the road to Saas-Fee was closed. The only road. We learned that a rockfall had completely destroyed the road and over 2000 tourists were stuck in the valley, which had to be transported out by helicopter. ![road closed](src/assets/images/alphubel/road_closed.jpg)

## New plan

We quickly sat together and looked for alternative huts and tours in the nearby Zermatt valley.
We decided to call the [Täschhütte](https://www.taeschhuette.ch/huette) and allthough the woman on the other end was a bit grumpy, we secured four spots.

## Arrival

We drove through Täsch and up the toll road to the Täschalp, which sits 500hm below the Täschhütte.
We geared up and hiked up to the hut in just over an hour.

We checked in with the staff and learned that we had to wake up at 3:00 in the night to go for Alphubel the next day. So we quickly went to bed at 22:00.

## Mountaineering

We woke up at 3:00 as planned, had breakfast at 3:30 and were ready to go at 4:00.

After three hours the sun came up and we were finally able to see some mountains.

We geared up with crampons, harness and rope and went up.

After some more hours we were above the clouds at 3500m+.

One of our group had to abort mission and went down to the hut with two oncoming mountaineers (another story).
So three left we were.

Strong ice winds tried challenged us on our push to the top, but we persevered.

(On the top ridge of the Alphubel - only few meters to go, but very exposed)

Finally we reached the top after 8 hours of hiking up!

We rested a bit and hiked down again in 4 hours.

## Camping

After we reached the car, we drove to the [Camping Attermenzen](https://www.campingranda.ch/deu/) to sleep for the night.
It was a very beautiful camping site with mountains surrounding the valley. The price was only 59 CHF for four persons in our van and tent and the toilets and showers were very high quality and clean for this price.

## Zermatt

The next day we woke up to a day of clouds and rain. So we packed our stuff before the rain started and headed for Zermatt for a touristy day.

Not much had to be said about this trip. The town is very touristy, all shops were open on that Sunday and the Döner we had cost 14.50 CHF. We did some window shopping to kill the time and explore new gear.
