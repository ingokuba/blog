# Hochtourenkurs auf dem [Großvenediger](https://www.osttirol.com/entdecken-und-erleben/sommer/wandern/detail/grossvenediger-3657-m-defregger-haus/)

In this course we learned how to walk on a glacier and how to save us and others from crevasses.

## Arrival

We drove from Stuttgart to Hinterbichl in Osttirol, where we met our guide [Thomas](https://www.instagram.com/thomas_mattersberger_/) on the parking lot for the [Johannishütte](https://www.alpenverein-muenchen-oberland.de/huetten/alpenvereinshuetten/johannishuette).

We took the Venedigertaxi to the Johannishütte, which was a fun ride up the mountain in a lifted Mercedes Sprinter.

We started the 800hm hike up to our hut for the next three nights - the [Defreggerhaus](https://www.huetten-holiday.com/huts/defreggerhaus).

## Practicing

Despite the fun we also found a good crevasse (or ice cave) to abseil into for practicing to save ourselves and others.

We then hiked back to our hut and got into alot of hail.
